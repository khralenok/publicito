            between pages efficiently, ensure security of the webpage or
            application, understand how their websites are used, remember user

          </p>
          <p>
            Below, we will provide additional information that will help you
            make better decisions about it:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Cookies can be of various types depending on their purpose:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Technical cookies are necessary for our website to work, do not
                need your authorization and they are the only ones we have
                activated by default.

                The rest of cookies can be used to improve our page, to
                personalize it based on your preferences, or to be able to show
                you advertising adjusted to your searches, tastes and personal
                interests. All of them are deactivated by default, being
                necessary your prior authorization for its activation, which you
                can take by a step as simple and fast as the marking of a box in
                our Cookies Settings section.
              </p>

                Some cookies are ours and others belong to external companies
                that provide services for our website (we will call them
                third-party cookies: an example could be cookies from external
                providers such as Google). In this sense, it is important that
                you know that some of these external suppliers may be located
                outside of Spain.

            Globally, not all countries have the same level of data protection,
            with some countries being safer than others (for example, the
            European Union is a secure environment for your data). Our policy is
            to rely on reliable suppliers who, regardless of whether or not they
            are located in the European Union, have adopted the appropriate
            guarantees for the protection of your personal information.

            Finally, we want to inform you that, depending on the period of time
            they remain active, cookies can be of two different types:

            <li>
              <p>
                Session cookies: they expire automatically when you finish the
                session on your computer, smartphone or tablet. They are usually
                used to keep the necessary information while providing a service
                only once.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Persistent cookies: they remain stored on your computer,
                smartphone or tablet for a certain period, which can vary from a
                few minutes to several years.
