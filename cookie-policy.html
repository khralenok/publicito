            Browser cookies are text files with small pieces of data downloaded

            to information stored on your device to enable certain features and
            distinguish you from other visitors. These technologies are used by

            efficiently, ensure security of the webpage or application,
            understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences

            Below, we will provide additional information that will help you
            make better decisions about it:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cookies can be of various types depending on their purpose:
              <ul style="margin-left: 1em">
                <li>
Technical cookies are necessary for our website to work, do
                    not need your authorization and they are the only ones we
                    have activated by default.
                </li>
                <li>
The rest of cookies can be used to improve our page, to
                    personalize it based on your preferences, or to be able to
                    show you advertising adjusted to your searches, tastes and
                    personal interests. All of them are deactivated by default,
                    being necessary your prior authorization for its activation,
                    which you can take by a step as simple and fast as the
                    marking of a box in our<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Cookies
                    Settings<strong>&nbsp;</strong>section.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <li>
              Some cookies are ours and others belong to external companies that
              provide services for our website (we will call
              them&nbsp;third-party cookies: an example could be cookies from
              external providers such as Google). In this sense, it is important
              that you know that some of these external suppliers may be located
              outside of Spain.
            </li>

            Globally, not all countries have the same level of data
            protection, with some countries being safer than others (for
            example, the European Union is a secure environment for your data).
            Our policy is to rely on reliable suppliers who, regardless of
            whether or not they are located in the European Union, have adopted
            the appropriate guarantees for the protection of your personal
            information.

              when you finish the session on your computer, smartphone or
              tablet. They are usually used to keep the necessary information
              while providing a service only once.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Persistent cookies:&nbsp;</strong>they remain stored on
              your computer, smartphone or tablet for a certain period, which
              can vary from a few minutes to several years.
